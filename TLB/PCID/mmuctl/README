This kernel module allows you to access the entire physical address space and
the paging structures up to the point of full modification. Furthermore, this
module allows you to configure the PAT in order to mark certain memory regions
with specific memory types.

Use this kernel module with caution as it provides access to the entire
physical address space and the paging structures of your system without the
need for root.
